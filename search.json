See the README for details.\nCreate a new branch: (e.g. git checkout -b my-branch-name)\nMake your change\nPush to your branch (and fork if applicable) and submit a pull request\n\nYour pull request will then be reviewed. You may receive some feedback and suggested changes before it can be approved and your pull request merged.\n\n\n\nIf you are making visual changes, include a screenshot of what the affected element looks like, both before and after.  \nKeep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.\nWrite good commit messages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way is just to open the repo in Github Codespaces - you can then make your changes, run the website to check it, and commit those back all within a VSCode environment.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to use Github codespaces (or can’t because it’s blocked, or you’ve run out of credits), then you can make changes to the repo locally on your machine.\n\n\n\n\nSee the README for guidance on installing the dependencies and getting started with development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the relevant subfolder within sections (e.g. sections/02-section/pages)\nAdd a qmd file with the following header fields: ---     title: \"This is the title of your page\"     description: \"This is a brief description of your page\"     image-alt: \"This text will show if your image can't be displayed\"     image: &lt;name of a .jpg file stored in the same subfolder to use for the card&gt;     ---\nAdd the content below the header using standard markdown syntax.\nA link to the page will be added as a card on the landing page.
